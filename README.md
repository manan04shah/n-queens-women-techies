Project Title: Combating Workplace Microaggressions

Problem Statement:
In modern workplaces, microaggressions often go unnoticed but have significant impacts, particularly on marginalized groups, such as women. These subtle expressions of bias undermine morale and create an uncomfortable work environment. Recognizing and addressing these microaggressions is crucial for fostering inclusivity and equality in the workplace.

Solution Overview:
Our platform is a comprehensive solution designed to address the issue of workplace microaggressions and empower women in the workplace. Our platform leverages cutting-edge technology to proactively identify and address microaggressive language in workplace communications, providing a safer and more inclusive environment for all employees.

Key Features:

Microaggression Detection Model:
We have developed a sophisticated machine learning model that analyzes email content to flag potential microaggressions. By identifying subtle language and behaviors, our model helps raise awareness and prevent unintentional biases in workplace communications.

Anonymous Reporting System:
Our platform offers a secure and anonymous reporting system, allowing employees, particularly women, to report instances of harassment or microaggressions without fear of judgment or retaliation. This feature empowers individuals to speak up and facilitates a more transparent and accountable workplace culture.

This chatbot assists women in understanding their rights and provides guidance on navigating legal avenues for addressing workplace harassment. By offering accessible legal support, we aim to empower women to take action against harassment and discrimination.
